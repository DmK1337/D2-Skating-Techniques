# D2-Skating-Techniques
These AutoHotkey scripts are made for Well/Shatter Dive skating in Destiny 2.  
To successfully skate with these scripts you need to have
1. A sword with Eager Edge equipped but not holding in your hands
2. Ammo for the sword

The original versions of the scripts require you to stand on a ledge but provide a lot of speed to travel great distances.  
The v2 scripts can be used almost everywhere but provide less speed and/or height than the original ones.

Running the .ahk scripts directly requires to have [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed.  
Alternatively you can use the compiled executables from [Releases](https://github.com/DmK1337/D2-Skating-Techniques/releases).  
**Activate the scripts by pressing ctrl+g (this can be changed in the .ahk files)**
